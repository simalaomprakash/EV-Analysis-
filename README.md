#  EV Market Dashboard - Resume Project Challenge 12 ðŸš—

## Overview

This project is part of the **Resume Project Challenge 12** organized by Codebasics. The goal was to analyze the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market, focusing on sales trends, penetration rates, and growth projections, and to provide actionable insights for AtliQ Motors' expansion plans in India.

## Problem Statement

## Project Goals

- Analyze key metrics such as Total EV Sales, Penetration Rates, and CAGR of EV Sales from 2022 to 2024.
- Compare the performance of top EV makers and identify states with significant market potential.
- Project EV sales trends for 2030 and provide strategic insights for AtliQ Motors.
